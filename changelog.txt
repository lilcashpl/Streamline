======== Release 2.2.1 Entries ========

    * Added support for DLSS Frame Generation Dynamic Frame Generation.
      See section 22.0 "Dynamic Frame Generation" in `ProgrammingGuideDLSS_G.md`
      for more information.

    * Added two new buffer types:
      - `sl::kBufferTypeTransparencyLayer`
      - `sl::kBufferTypeTransparencyLayerOpacity`
      See section 4.1.10 "Transparency Overlay" in `ProgrammingGuideDLSS_RR.md`

    * Added new buffer type `sl::kBufferTypeBidirectionalDistortionField` for
      post-processed distortion patterns applied to the backbuffer and
      `sl::kBufferTypeUIColorAndAlpha`.
      See section 5.0 "TAG ALL REQUIRED RESOURCES" in `ProgrammingGuideDLSS_G.md`
      for more information.

    * Added a new `sl::Constants` field `minRelativeLinearDepthObjectSeparation`
      for describing the minimum depth difference between two objects in screen-space.

    * Added a new structure `sl::PrecsisionInfo` for specifying floating-point
      precision bias for a `sl::Resource`.
      See section 2.8 "TAGGING RESOURCES" in `ProgrammingGuide.md` for more
      information.

    * Fixed a bug where `sl.interposer.dll` would crash if plugins were located
      in paths containing wide characters.

    * Fixed a bug where verbose logging would not include additional information for OTA Updates.

    * Updated documentation for `sl::DLSSGMode::eOff` to match current behavior.
